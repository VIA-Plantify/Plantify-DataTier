## Creating a dev container

<h1>MAKE SURE YOUR DOCKER SERVICE IS RUNNING</h1>


Open **Settings -> File -> Remote Development**

On the left click devcontainers and create new if it doesn t already exist.

If it exists just press on the container you want to work on:

If the container does not exist create one.
Select **FROM VCS PROJECT** and put in the following link:

https://github.com/VIA-Plantify/Plantify-DataTier.git

select **development or the branch currently under development** and go to specific version of devcontainer.

<h2>If running on linux or wsl use .devcontainer/devcontainer.linux.json</h2>

<h2>If running on Windows use .devcontainer/devcontainer.windows.json</h2>

## Refreshing Grpc Container Manual

# IMPORTANT
### For the Grpc container to run properly you must have the database running from the container provided

inside the devcontainer run: ``scripts/refresh-grpc.sh``

outside container it gets a bit more complicated,
I know only for linux, but it should work in WSL:

run: ``chmod +x scripts/refresh-grpc.sh`` to make it executable

afterwards run: ``./scripts/refresh-grpc.sh``

## Refresh Grpc Container Button

Go to the top of the options where usually the program is being ran

<img width="406" height="216" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03598e4e-6e03-444f-a7d1-ca2e43a01426" />

Click on the arrow nad go to edit configurations

There you should see a "+" sign

<img width="421" height="196" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39819896-ce8e-448e-8de1-7c9ce32e8867" />

Click on the "+" scroll down and find the shell script option

<img width="368" height="522" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70c645a7-066b-43a9-924a-d480cd364bd1" />

Add the script and the correct path from scripts and apply

Now you should have a button that runs the script

## Troubleshooting 

### Not seeing containers in docker desktop

Make sure to uncheck the show only running containers
options to see everything.

### Database container dependency

If the gRPC container does not work or start make sure the postgres container is running

### Stale image

Make sure to pull in all the changes in development before continuing, some of the code and fixes might have been already made

Run the refresh script made in the previous step to refresh the production container.

### Older images and volumes

If the container configuration has been changed or problems persist, delete the images of the container and the jetbrains volumes (not shared volume)

To see the volumes and images either use ur GUI tool (For windows try docker desktop) (For linux I recommend lazydocker to see images and volumes along side ducker to see running containers)

If a GUI tool does not exist or cannot be accessed run the follwoing commands

#### Volumes
Run
```shell 
docker volume ls
```

Look for:
```
local     jb_devcontainer_sources_ ...
```

Run
```shell
docker rm (volume name)
```

#### Images
Run
```shell
docker image ls
```

Look for: 
```
plantify-businesstier-businessdev:latest     
plantify-businesstier_plantify-businesstier-businessdev:latest
plantify-datatier-datadev:latest
plantify-datatier-grpcserver:latest
plantify-datatier_plantify-datatier-datadev:latest
plantify-datatier_plantify-datatier-grpcserver:latest
```
Run
```shell
docker rm (image name)
```

#### Network

```shell
docker network list
```
Look for
```
backend
```

If the problem persists run:

```shell
docker network rm backend
```

Close and rebuild the containers or use to create the network
```shell
docker network create --driver bridge backend
```

### Rider not displaying files

If you do not see the files after opening 
a container close the container and restart rider, they will show up after.

### Rider hangs when creating containers

If rider hangs try going into a project then to remote development and try that.

### Script failing inside container

Rebuild the container after pulling in the project or go back and [delete volumes images](#older-images-and-volumes) and do a fresh install.
