If the container does not exist create one.
Select **FROM VCS PROJECT** and put in the following link:

# IMPORTANT
### For the Grpc container to run properly you must have the database running from the container provided

## Refreshing Grpc Container 
inside the devcontainer run: ``scripts/refresh-grpc.sh``

outside container it gets a bit more complicated,
I know only for linux but it should work in WSL:

run: ``chmod +x scripts/refresh-grpc.sh`` to make it executable

afterwards run: ``./scripts/refresh-grpc.sh``

## Making an IDE button for refresh script in Rider

Go to the top of the options where usually the program is being ran

Click on the arrow nad go to edit configurations

There you should see a "+" sign

Click on the "+" scroll down and find the shell script option

Add the script and the correct path from scripts and apply

Now you should have a button that runs the script
